# RowerWebsiteFrontend
# Summary
This repository consists of the code for the frontend of a personal fullstack web application project. The frontend currently renders the rowers and the rowing clubs on screen with their respective relevant information such as height, weight, website urls and location. Later, a more refined user interface will be implemented.

The website is developed using React with TypeScript and utilizes the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) build tool.

## Note
The website, as of 11.30.23, does not have a server. The server was deleted as the website is no longer being developed. The website will possibly be deployed using a new server later, but as of now, the website is not functioning. A demonstration of the website from when the website had a server can be found with the following youtube links:
