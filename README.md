# RowerWebsiteFrontend
# Summary
This repository consists of the code for the frontend of a personal fullstack web application project. The frontend currently renders the rowing clubs on screen with their respective member counts, website urls and location. Later, a more refined user interface will be implemented, and different pages of the website will be available where the user can scroll through information about rowing clubs and their members (rowers). 

The website is developed using React with TypeScript and utilizes the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) build tool.

## Run locally: 
1. Install node packet manager (npm) on your local device. Further info on how to download npm can be found on the following page: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager.
2. Download dependencies from packages.json by writing `npm install` in the command line.
3. Use the command `npm run dev` and open the localhost url.
